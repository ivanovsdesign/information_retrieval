Welcome to the Information Retrieval repository! This project focuses on web scraping from Wildberries and implementing advanced techniques for content vectorization and multimodal embeddings.

## 🌟 Features

- **Wildberries Scraper**: Utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from Wildberries, as detailed in `wb_scraper.ipynb`.
- **Content Vectorization**: Implements methods to convert textual content into numerical vectors for machine learning.
- **Multimodal Embeddings**: Creates embeddings that combine different types of data (text, images, etc.) for richer representations.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with the Information Retrieval project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivanovsdesign/information_retrieval.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```bash
cd information_retrieval
```

3. **Explore the Notebooks**:

    - Open `wb_scraper.ipynb` to learn how to scrape data from Wildberries.

    - Open `wb_content_vect_colab.ipynb` to understand the workflow for content vectorization and creating multimodal embeddings.
